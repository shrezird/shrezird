Hey there! My name is Shrezird (pronounced sh-reh-zurd). Don’t ask me how I came up with the name… just don’t. If you’re actually reading this, it means my numerous social media accounts worked out after all. Or... I did something to piss you off. Either way... WELCOME TO MY GITHUB!

There’s not much here at the moment because I’m still in the *I want to make something but let me fantasize about it first* stage in my journey as an independent game developer/software engineer. I spend 99.9% of my spare time procrastinating (thanks, ADHD!) and the rest working full-time or in most cases overtime. If you want to see what I've been working on lately, feel free to check out my many social media accounts or my amazing website that totally didn’t take me about 8 months to finish. Ciao!

PS: You are amazing... sometimes. <3
